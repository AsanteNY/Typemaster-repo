# Typemaster-repo
Typemaster pre-launch landing page
This a project to program a webpage using HTML/CSS to be as close to a given design as possible
The initial idea was to implement gitflow from scratch but due to certain challenges, the code was written locally in Visual Studio Code.
The project tested all aspects of HTML/CSS knowledge.
The webpage is responsive and is catered to adapt to different screen sizes.
The colors and positions were determined using the fig file.
